-An if statement can be used to conditionally execute code, depending on
whether or not the if statement's condition is True or False.
- An elif(that is, "else if") statement can follow an if statement. Its block executes
if its condition is True and all of the previous conditions have been False.
-An else statement comes at the end. Its block is executed if all of the previous
conditions have been False.
- The value 0, 0.0, and the empty string are considered to be Falsey values.
When used in conditions they are considered False. You can always see for yourself which values
are Truthy or Falsey by passing them to the bool() function
